## FAQ about the EULA

**2) May I redistribute the ONNX/models?**  
Only **verbatim** files released by the Licensor. Third-party models follow their own licenses.

**5) Do I need to report if no royalty is due?**  
No. You may skip or file a zero report. When royalties are due, report and pay within **30 days** after each calendar quarter.
